                  <h3>Responsive (mobile optimized) Web Design</h3>
                    <p>Internet usage on mobile devices (like smartphones and tablets) is rising, and people now spend more time surfing the Web on these devices than they do on their desktop computers. That's why having a responsive website that displays optimally, regardless of the device being used, is so important.</p>

                    <h5>Responsive web design is incredibly important, for a number of reasons:</h5>
                    <ol class="lower_alpha">
                        <li>
                            <h5>Responsive Websites are Fluid and Flexible</h5>
                            <p>From a marketing perspective, you already know that your customers are unique individuals. Due to the inherent fluidity of responsive websites, adopting a responsive design means that your website will automatically adapt to the individual visitor, based on the device that they're browsing from. By delivering consistent information across all devices, with a layout that's perfect for any screen size, you won't be giving visitors reason to abandon your website in frustration while browsing from their smartphone... or their smart TV.</p>
                            <p>In short, by supporting multiple devices, your new responsive website will provide visitors with an excellent user experience. No zooming in required.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Responsive Websites are Cost Effective</h5>
                            <p>In the past, if a website owner wanted a mobile-friendly website, they'd need an entirely separate site. That meant developing, and paying for, two different websites. Webmasters also needed to update both sites, resulting in a ton of wasted time. Compare that with responsive websites, where there's no difference between the desktop and mobile version. That's because it's all one website. The only difference is the visibility of images, content, and other elements. And when it's time to update the site with new content, you only have to do it once.</p>
                            <p>Responsive websites are also great for future scalability, as you can easily prepare for new devices as they become available. A few updates will make your site ready for those new devices, and there's no need to build a new website.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Improved Search Engine Rankings with Responsive Web Designs</h5>
                            <p>Google has a 67% market share in the search engine world, so when Google speaks, industry experts listen. The search engine giant recommends that websites be optimized for mobile viewing, and they even refer to responsive web design as the industry best practice.</p>
