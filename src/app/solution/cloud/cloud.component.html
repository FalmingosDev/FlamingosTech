                    <h5>If you're considering an ERP system for your business, chances are you're being flooded with choices. As you consider
your options, one of the most important decisions you'll need to make is whether to select a cloud-based ERP solution
or one that's installed locally.</h5>
                    
                </div>
                <div class="a_box">
                    <p>The basic difference between on-premise ERP and cloud ERP is clear: </p>
                    <h5>Ownership Costs</h5>
                    <p>On-premise ERP solutions are installed locally on your company's hardware and servers and then managed by your IT staff. While in case of a Cloud based ERP or CRM software and its associated data are managed centrally (in the Internet "cloud") by the ERP/CRM vendor and are accessed by customers using a web browser.</p>
                    <p>On-premise ERP or CRM systems usually require large upfront and ongoing investments to purchase and manage the software and the related hardware, servers, and facilities necessary to run it. If your company doesn't have a large or experienced IT staff, you may also have to also invest more time and money in additional personnel and train them. Even more importantly, on-premise systems require that your IT team spend a significant amount of their time and budgets to ensuring your system is up-and-running when you need it, including maintenance of hardware, servers and more.</p>
                    <p>For cloud-based ERP, initial costs are typically much lower because you simply implement the software to your requirements and then access it through your computer's internet connection. The cloud ERP provider hosts and maintains all of the IT infrastructure for you, ensures the system is always running, that the data is secure, and that product enhancements are rolled out painlessly to your solution without breaking your previously implemented customizations.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="a_box">
                    <h5>Improved System Performance and Accessibility</h5>
                    <p>It's also important to note that a cloud-based ERP solution provides real-time data that can be accessed via the Internet anywhere at any time. That means that staff at your company can see accurate information on laptops, smart phones, and tablet devices while they travel or telecommuteâ€”all without extra setup fees or ongoing costs.</p>
                    <p>Not only can cloud-based ERP provide better performance and greater accessibility, but better security as well. Because it's their core competency,</p>
                </div>
                <div class="a_box">
                    <h5>Deployment</h5>
                    <p>Every ERP deployment takes time and requires careful planning, but cloud ERP offers clear advantages when you consider speed of deployment. Since cloud ERP requires no additional hardware, your business doesn't have to waste time procuring and installing IT infrastructure. With cloud ERP, you can easily roll it out across multiple regions, subsidiaries, and divisions, avoiding the cost associated with those rollouts. If you chose a cloud-based ERP system, these differences can add up to a significant time savings.</p>
