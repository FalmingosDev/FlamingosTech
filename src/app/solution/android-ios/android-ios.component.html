                <h5>Mobile apps are great way to reach out potential customers. You can enhance the experience of your customers by building the best mobile app. Some of the benefits of a mobile app are:</h5>
                <ul class="checklist">
                    <li>Gives more value to the customers</li>
                    <li>Customers don’t have to wait</li>
                    <li>Reduces cost and increases customer engagement</li>
                    <li>Mobile apps aid promotion and offers great support</li>
                    <li>Enhances the visibility of your brand</li>
                    <li>Mobile apps are the best social media platform</li>
                </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Since mobile apps have become one of the most popular platforms to reach out to customers and boost your business, it is better to have a preliminary knowledge about the app mainly the variety and respective costs before reaching out to mobile app developers.</p>

                <h5>Hybrid apps</h5>
                <p>They are built using multi-platform web technologies (for example HTML5, CSS and Javascript). So-called hybrid apps are mainly website applications disguised in a native wrapper.</p>
                <p>Hybrid multi-platform apps are fast and relatively easy to develop – a clear advantage. Single code base for all platforms ensures low-cost maintenance and smooth updates. Widely used APIs, like gyroscope, accelerometer, geolocation are available.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, hybrid applications lack in performance, speed and overall optimization in comparison to native apps for instance. Also, there are certain design issues due to app inability to look in exactly same way on two or more platforms.</p>
                </div>
            <div class="m_top30">
                    <h5>Native apps</h5>
                <p>Such apps are developed for a single mobile operating system exclusively, therefore they are “native” for a particular platform or device. App built for popular systems like iOS and Android can not be used on a platform other than their own. In other words, you won’t be able to use Android app on iPhone. The other smartphone platforms, which are nowadays not very popular and widely accepted are Windows phone, Symbian and Blackberry.</p>
                <p>Main advantage of native apps is high performance and ensuring good user experience as developers use native device UI. Moreover, an access to wide range of APIs that puts no limitation on app usage. Native applications are distinctly accessible from app stores of their kind and have the clear tendency to reach target customers.</p>
                <p>Some cons to native apps are higher cost compared to other types of apps – due to the need of creating app duplicates for other platforms, separate support and maintenance for different types of apps resulting in bigger product price.</p>
